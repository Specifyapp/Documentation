## Design API

A Design API is an API designed to synchronize information in your design system. This includes design tokens, assets, components and documentation.

## Source

A source is a place that contains data you want to sync within your design system. Like a Figma file from which you sync your colors from. Or a GitHub repository containing your design tokens in JSON.

## Destination

A destination is a place in which you distribute data in. Like a GitHub repository consuming colors coming from your design system or a Notion database in which you document your icons.

## Pipeline

A pipeline is the route that connects a Source or a Destination to Specify. It helps you transform and synchronize data (e.g., design tokens) within your design system.

## Repository

A repository is like a folder containing your design tokens and assets in Specify. Use repositories to store and organize your design data.

## Token type

A Token type is a type of design token or asset supported by Specify like a colors, a text style or an icon. [See all token types](../concepts/token-types.md).

## Configuration

By default Specify returns design tokens and assets in JSON. Configure it to generate design data compatible with your company standards (e.g., CSS Variables).

## Rule

A rule is a part of your configuration that helps you transform one or several Token types the way you want. Like a rule to pull colors from Specify as CSS Variables in a CSS file.

## Parser

Parsers are functions allowing you to transform design tokens and assets coming from Specify to fit your needs and company standards. [See all parsers](../concepts/parsers.md#all-parsers-available).
