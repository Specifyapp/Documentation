{% endembed %}

## Before getting started

To get the most out of this guide, you will need:

* A Specify Account
* A Figma file containing Variables and/or Styles

## 1. Sync your Figma Variables and Styles with a Specify Repository

* Access your Figma file which includes the Variables and/or Styles you would like to sync to Specify
* [Download â†—](https://www.figma.com/community/widget/1182723580740552626/Specify---Sync-Tokens-and-Assets) the Specify Widget in the Figma file which includes your Variables and/or Styles. Or update the widget if you already have it. To update the Specify Widget you have to disconnect it, remove the entire frame in all of your Figma files, and reopen the latest version of the Widget.

## 2. Connect your Specify account

1. Follow the steps in the widget to connect your account. You will need to create a personal access token and you will need to add the link to the Figma file to which the widget is added. [Watch tutorial â†—](https://help.specifyapp.com/en/articles/6837203-how-to-use-the-figma-widget)
2. Click "Connect"
3. Choose **Advanced Repository**

1. Go to your Specify workspace
2. Click on "Create repository"

## 6. Check or delete your source inside the Specify interface

* You will see the category of design tokens that are synced on the left-hand side
* In the `Sources` section (left-hand menu), you will see your connection(s) and when the last sync between your Figma file and Specify repository has occurred.
* Delete your source by clicking on the 3 dots option menu in the source card.\
